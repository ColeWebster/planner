## Starting Point
- Have created time boxes for business hours 

- Have functional time

- Linked the dashed border to the hours

- Added blue color to save function

- Attended tutoring session (Input ids for text area and function help)

- Working on creating a function to change colors

##

- Starting to work on timer functions.

- Completed work on function to add the class to the time pulled down from the current day.

##

- Still need work on timer function

- Have reformatted HTML and have completed it, input is avaible for typing and save is now clickable

- Function adding classes works but needs to fine tune to connect with time.
